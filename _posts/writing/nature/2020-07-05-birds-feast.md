A Sunday morning in the DMV is silent.  It stands in contrast to the week's commutes.  There is a motionlessness, which allows nature to temporarily expand into humanity's temporary recess.  At these times, it's not unusual to spot birds of various feathers: hawks, song birds, or an owl's late retreat; deer grazing in the stream bed, using it as a travel lane; or a stray fox before it dashes into the underbrush.  From a distance, white tufts hop between green sod and wild-flower lawns.  These Eastern Cotton Tails chewing on various lawn clippings and weeds.  A Northern Mockingbird stands atop a telephone pole, flipping through its rolodex of calls.

A few early risers wend through the twists of the W&OD trail.  A few cars enter the frame as I step onto the main road.  Human commotion begins to encroach upon nature's earlier expansion.  It's time for it to recede.  

I head to the metro station.  I am lost in thought about how to phrase concepts, fill time, and entertain my students.  I am anxious as I cross the four-lane road.  My stomach lining feels taught.  Every minute, I relax my tensed jaw.  Overcome by anxiety, I stop, place my index finger to the dent in my nose and breath.  In.  Out.  I brace myself on a chain-lined face.  I look around to lower my trepidation.

A crow sits in the road.  Its foot presses upon a corpse.  The beak rips muscle from the exposed spindly bones.  Fluffs of blotchy white fur tumble nearby, nudged by a puff of wind.  An automobile had recently treaded a squirrel.  The traffic light turns green up ahead and a second car speeds toward the feasting crow.  It looks like it will share a similar fate to the carrion.  I wait to see how the situation will resolve itself.  A caw emits from a sentry perched on a jaundiced street lamp.  The crow unfurls its tucked wings and joins his friend atop the fixture, pecking at an unseen object.  I walk past the roadkill toward my destination.

Two squirrels balance on a wooden fencepost.  They appear sad to me: hunched together, their paws clutching a slightly nibbled acorn.  Their black eyes fail to emote how their brain is processing the scene before them: their possible offspring crushed by a tire.  However, they simply could have been looking for fallen acorns as the winter approaches.  I continue on and swipe through the turnstiles.
