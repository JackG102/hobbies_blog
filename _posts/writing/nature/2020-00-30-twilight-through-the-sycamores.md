One evening, I went for a walk to Madison Manor Park: a postage stamp green space with tennis courts and a playground.  The week's cumulative demands had eroded my energy as I stressed about bills and general life choices.  I stepped from the sidewalk onto the park's faded green grass.   Light laughter emanated from the group of children playing soccer.  They were oblivious to their parents shuffling in place ready to leave.  The sun had set.

Not wanting to cut through the soccer game, I outlined the edge of the field near a thin stream.  At the field's end, I looked into the sky.  The sun had set, yes, but the western sky's burnt-orange light blinded my eyes, which had adjusted to the dark cast by the Sycamore trees.  The twilight's pressure burst through the recently deleafed trees.  

Despite the kids swishing through the worn grass and the creak of the metro train, the atmosphere was vacuous: a silence painful to the ears accustomed to the reception of continuous sound.  It was uncomfortable.  I needed to move.  Moving met not hearing the silence, avoiding the twilight's bright rays.  To return to my comfortable thoughts about what to do at work when Monday arrived in two day's time.  I unfolded my scuffed flip phone and called my parents like any son should do.  I felt better.
