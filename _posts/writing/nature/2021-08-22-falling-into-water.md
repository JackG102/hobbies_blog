The Birder sat down on a frayed lawn chair at his favorite park.  He hadn’t been outside in some time as the Birder was prudent during the times of the pandemic.  He saw how other families on the weekends, packed themselve in at pavillions grilling, laughing, and exchanging pleasantries.  Hundreds of people crowded the park.  He made the necessary, if awkward, dodge if people came to close as he walked towards his birding spot near the edge of the lake, just off to the side of the paddle boat house.

He packed a lunch for the day.  He had also brought the binoculars, the spotting scope, a note pad, a pen, the lawn chair, and a thermos of coffee with an accompanying mug emblazoned with a Pileated Woodpecker that said “Got wood?”

The pandemic’s novelty had worn off.  The peace and quiet of the first few weeks were replaced by the city’s bustle again.  People had adjusted to the new normal.  Few people hadn’t been impacted in some way by the pandemic: dieing, becoming sick, being laid off, or the mnental weight of if the pandemic would end, if at all.  The fact that the bubonic plague ravaged Europe for years over multiple centuries suddenly became relevant to the Birder.

Having arrived at his birding spot, he went about arranging his camp that would be his home for the next few hours: spread apart the spotting scope’s tripod, crack open the notebook and mark down the current time and location, and pour the first half-cup of coffee.  The steam floated into the air as this day reached bearable temperatures if the sun’s rays blanketed you as it made it’s traversal across the sky.

The Birder wanted to see a raft of water fowl.  It was that time of year.  For the first 20 minutes, he scanned the browned water with the spotting scope, noting what he saw: ‘Canada Geese (common), Great Blue Heron (perched on a snag, motionless), Mallards (hiding among the geese), Ruddy Ducks (trio, exciting!).’  The bincoculars provided another collection of the usual birds: wrens (singing in the bushes), jays (screeching), robins (eating winter berries), and crows (American variety).    

He grew bored.  The pandemic had taken a toll on him.  His youthful face cracked.  His eyes red veined from looking at his monitor for work.  What began as a break from ennui and the daily routine, continued into a digital isolation chamber.  His anxieties increased.  He had no one to talk to during the day.  He worked in a small, makeshift office at 8am and turned it off at 4pm.  He nary said a word unless he was called into a meeting.

A shrill voice caught his ear.  Some distance across the lake, a person slipped and fell into the water.  The walking path ran along the edge of the lake and the shrubs on the other side had become overgrown, forcing walkers to tippy toe along the sloped--and muddy--bank. He then noticed that a number of groups were going to have to navigate this tricky part of the path that would force them to maybe fall in the water. 

He began to snicker. 

A real drama was unfolding before him.  No amount of TV shows or movies in the past year compared to this -- the result uncertain, the enjoyment of being a voyeur seeing each person begin to realize what banal danger lay ahead.  

One by one, they fell.  

A mother of two tried to guide the way for her bundled up tykes.  Her right leg plunged knee high into the water.  Her kids howled. 

A father, ignorning the danger, lost his footing. He fell on his rear which soon slid down the muddy bank into the water.  He ambled up the bank, his buttocks filled with slop.  He continued on in silence down the path with his kids, who had navigated the pass with aplomb.

Walkers would see this happen ahead of them prepared: tightening their laces, giving advice to their little ones, and some even turned around.

The drama reached it’s height as a family arrived in the ‘danger zone’ as the Birder now classified it.  What he presumed to be the aunt seemed to be most likely to fall in.  She was chatting with the kids, smiling, and seemed oblivious to what lay ahead.  He saw that that her chador would hinder her crossing.  She stopped as the other warned of the impending danger, seeing the ruts, bumps, and skids of previous victims.  Each family member managed to slip and slide to the other end with moderate success, only a muddy shoe or sock.  The woman in the cloak waited for her turn.

The aunt lifted her garment to avoid tripping herself.  Her ankles began to wobble on the slope as she reached the beginning of the muddied slide.  

Her voice cracked as a foot slipped, momentarily.  

The others roared with laughter.  

It was infectious.  

The Birder begain to laugh, more and more.  Seeing the poor woman so woefully prepared yet in high spirits buoyed him.  

She took another step and her bald flats gave out.  She fell headfirst into the lake.  Her sister doubled over.  The husband rushed out, if a bit gingerly, into the chilled lake to help.  The woman rose to the surface.  Her chador floated like a lily pad, her head at the center.  Initially, her face contorted in anger seeing her family laughing.  After a moment, she too realized how absurd this was and began to laugh as she was helped out.  A warm blanket was brought to her.  The whole family huddle around to assist.  Soon, she was in dry clothes and a new memory had been born in the pandemic.   

Feeling like this could not be superceded, the Birder began to pack up. A hawk flew overhead. He scrambled over his char to grab his binoculars, knocking over the cold coffee onto his shoe.  A person nearby chuckled.  He looked up and shared the laugh.
